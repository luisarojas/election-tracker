## Overview

To avoid a heart-attack induced by refreshing the election results (way) too often, I decided to, instead, create a web scraper that could check for updates for me.

The script uses [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Elections) as its source and checks it every 15 minutes. If any changes are identified, an e-mail will be sent to all recipients specified in the `env.py` file (not included).

<p style="color: grey;">Disclaimer: Please note that I wrote this program in a bit of a rush, since the election is close to its conclusion. I'm aware there is plenty of room for refactoring and general improvement!</p>


## Technologies

* `python==3.8.6`
* `beautifulsoup4==4.9.3`
* `lxml==4.6.1`
* `requests==2.24.0`


## Usage

### Inputs

No command-line inputs are required; only your `env.py` is needed.

**What should your `env.py` look like?**

```python
ENV = {
    'recipient': {
        'emails': ['recipient1@mail.com', 'recipient2@mailcom']
    },
    'sender': {
        'email': 'sender@email.com',
        'password': 'senderpassword'
    }
}
```
<p style="color: grey;">Note: If using Gmail, you should enable the setting to allow access from "less secure apps".</p>

### Testing Environment

When the `testing_env` variable is set to `True`:

* An e-mail will always be sent, regardless of if there is a change or not
* Only the first recipient in the `emails` list will receive the e-mail.
* The e-mail subject will indicate whether the e-mail is a test or not.

### Execution

```
$ pipenv run python run.py
```
